        <h3>Project 1-Driver Drowsiness detection </h3>
        <p>Due to the increase in the amount of automobile in recent years, problems created by accidents have become more complex. The official investigation reports of traffic accidents point out those dangerous driving behaviours , such as drunk and drowsy driving, which have taken a high proportion among all the accidents. It is necessary to develop an appropriate driver drowsiness and alertness system that can directly improve the driving safety. 

          The drowsiness detection method uses Haar based cascade classifier for eye tracking and combination of Histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for blink detection.</p>
